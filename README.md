A new hall pass system using electronic scanners for student ID's

Students will scan their student ID at the door, which will tell the server that they have signed out of that classroom.
During that time, if the student ID is scanned at another classroom, they will be shown as having arrived in that class.
If the original room is scanned again, the student will be shown as having returned to their original class, and the pass will end.
